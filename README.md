## 📌 Project Summary

NC News is an interactive news platform where users can explore articles, filter them by topic, and sort results based on different criteria. Each article page includes its full content, an image, comment threads, and voting functionality.

The frontend is built with **React** and communicates with a fully hosted REST API on **Render**, enabling live updates such as posting comments, deleting comments, and adjusting vote counts with optimistic rendering.

### Users can:

- Browse all published articles
- View articles by topic
- Sort articles by date, votes, or number of comments
- Toggle between ascending and descending order
- Read full articles
- Post comments as the default user
- Delete comments authored by the logged-in user
- Vote on articles with instant UI updates
