# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Official Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- **@vitejs/plugin-react** — uses Babel (or oxc when used in rolldown-vite) for Fast Refresh
- **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc** — uses SWC for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled in this template because of its impact on dev and build performance.  
To add it, see the official documentation.

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled.  
Check out the **TS template** for information on how to integrate TypeScript and **typescript-eslint** into your project.
